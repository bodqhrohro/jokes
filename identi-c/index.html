<h1>Identi-C</h1>
<h2>About</h2>
<p><i>This a specific software development related joke. See
<a href="../showtime-komputeishon">Showtime Komputeishon</a> for the context.</i>
</p>

<p><b>Identi-C™</b> ([aɪˈdentɪ si] or [aɪˈdentɪk]) is a graphical development
environment. Coding primitives are represented as visual blocks which are
connected with distinctive lines. They easily and rapidly can be placed on the
canvas with the help of useful keyboard macros. Internal schema representation
is transparently converted to (a set of) C source code files, which are then
compiled with the system-provided C compiler. The development cycle is
tremendously simplified. One mouse click starts the program translation and
compilation, with the subsequent immediate program execution.</p> <p>Staggering
compatibility technology And-Then-C-Libraries-Can-Be-Used™ ensures any library
with a C-compatible interface can be used with a trivial porting effort. The
presented prototype includes out-of-the-box GTK+3 and GLib support, which
already covers almost all features a desktop application will ever need!
<p>Moreover, <b>Identi-C™</b> is implemented in itself!</p>
